I first connected the Adafruit Electret Microphone Amplifier to measure sound levels with the Arduino.

The Microphone Amplifier mates an Electret Capsule Microphone with a MAX4466 Operational Amplifier optimized for use in microphone pre-amplifier applications.  The flexible supply voltage and and adjustable gain make this module adaptable to a wide variety of audio applications.

Specifications:
Supply Voltage: 2.4v-5v
Output: Rail-to-Rail - up to to 5vp-p
Frequency Response: 20Hz - 20 KHz
Adjustable Gain 25x-125x

## Week 3
- For this project, I would like to try something related to music by using Arduino. I've always wanted to learn how to play the piano, however, the real instrument is expensive and heavy to move. When I was told "You can use Arduino to play music" by professor, I'm so excited and wanted to have to have a try.

## Week 2
- This is a Music Reactive LED strip, It was so cool that the strip can play the music and make it shine.
I'm interested in inserting music into my arduino project, so I'm concerned about how can I do this kind of project in the future.
The author used the Arduino Nano as the base. Used the FFT library to decode the sound into octaves, FASTLed library to drive the led strips, and an old iPhone C case to hold it all together.
